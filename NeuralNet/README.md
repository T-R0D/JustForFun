# Artificial Neural Network
This is an implementation of a simple fully-connected, feed-forward artificial neural network. The main file hack-ishly trains the network on the XOR function, with success. The training is done in steps of 400 samples at a time, as determined by the user.

This is implemented in C++11.

Ideally the Neuron class should be nested in the ConnectedFeedForwardNeuralNetwork class, but for ease of compilation is not.
