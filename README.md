# JustForFun
Various small (likely one-off) projects meant to be fun, educational, or both.

Ideally, there will be a README in each folder, explaining what the project is and its significance. I apologize if I fall behind on documentation and such things.

I wanted to have one place where I could put miscellaneous projects, so I'm sorry if you think you might want to clone/pull/borrow anything via the repository. If you have comments/pull requests/improvements, I guess you will have to either deal with cloning the entire repository or email me or something.
